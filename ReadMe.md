# CCTweaks [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SquidDev-CC/CCTweaks.svg?branch=minecraft-1.7.10)](https://travis-ci.org/SquidDev-CC/CCTweaks)

This fork aims to provide the websocket API to computercraft 1.75 (MC 1.7.10).
Yes we are in 2024, I know I should update...

----------------------------------------------------
Miscellaneous changes for ComputerCraft

**The 1.7.10 branch has been discontinued. I will release patches for major game-breaking bugs, but do not expect minor bugs to be fixed.**

## Important!
CCTweaks is a core mod and makes modifications to the internals of ComputerCraft. Whilst the mod is thoroughly tested there may be issues. If you encounter any bugs report them *here* and **not** on the ComputerCraft issue tracker. This will ensure a faster response time and will ensure you do not frustrate DanTwoHundred. 

Thanks :smile!

## Contributing
### Code and dependencies:
You'll need Git installed. If you are using Windows, replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat`
 - `git clone https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/CC-Tweaks`
 - `./gradlew build` This should download all dependencies. You can test with `./gradlew runClient`
 - To get the deobfuscated sources run `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`

Because of how the CCTweaks works, you may experience issues using the built in IDE tasks to run this project.

## Including in your own project
CCTweaks is available on Maven. To include it in your project you will need the following code:

```groovy
